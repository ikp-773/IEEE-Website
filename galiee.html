        <p>IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) is the world’s largest international
            society of biomedical engineers. The organization’s 10,000 members reside in some 97 countries
            around the world. EMBS provides its members with access to the people, practices, information,
            ideas and opinions that are shaping one of the fastest growing fields in science. Our members
            design the electrical circuits that make a pacemaker run, create the software that reads an MRI,
            and help develop the wireless technologies that allow patients and doctors to communicate over
            long distances. Our Members are interested in bioinformatics, biotechnology, biomechanics,
            clinical engineering, information technology, instrumentation and measurement, micro and
            nanotechnology, radiology, and robots. They are researchers and educators, technicians and
            clinicians - biomedical engineers are the link between science and life science, creating
            innovations in healthcare technology for the benefit of all humanity. IEEE Engineering in
            Medicin e and Biology Society Technical Communities (TCs) are formed in targeted areas of
            biomedical engineering and include experts from academia, industry, and government. These TCs
            coordinate conferences, publications and member development within their area of expertise. We
            welcome volunteers! </p></div>

        <p class="box2"> Signal processing is the enabling technology for the generation, transformation, extraction,
            and interpretation of information. It comprises the theory, algorithms with associated
            architectures and implementations, and applications related to processing information contained
            in many different formats broadly designated as signals. Signal processing uses mathematical,
            statistical, computational, heuristic, and/or linguistic representations, formalisms, modeling
            techniques and algorithms for generating, transforming, transmitting, and learning from signals.
            The Society sponsors various conferences, including the International Conference on Acoustics,
            Speech, and Signal Processing. If you wish to purchase additional copies of publications included
            in your membership, please visit the IEEE Contact Center. Societies offer an electronic-only
            membership option at a reduced rate for individuals who reside in developing countries. You will
            receive electronic/digital versions of your publications. Reduced fees such as unemployed, retired
            or minimum income are not available for the Essential package, but may be applied to the Preferred
            package. </p></div>

        <p> In keeping with IEEE’s continued commitment to providing options to support the needs of all authors, IEEE
            is introducing an Open Journal for the IEEE Computer Society.
            We invite you to be among the first to have your article peer-reviewed and published in this new journal.
            This is an exciting opportunity for your research to benefit from the high visibility and interest the
            journal’s marketing launch will generate. Your work will also be exposed to 5 million unique monthly users
            of the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.
            The IEEE Open Journal of the Computer Society will draw on the expert technical community to continue IEEE’s
            commitment to publishing the most highly-cited content. The editor in chief is the distinguished Song Guo
            from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. His research interests are in big data, cloud computing, mobile
            computing, and distributed systems, with more than 450 papers published in major conferences and journals.
            Prof. Guo is an associate editor of four IEEE publications, has served as chair for numerous IEEE
            conferences, and is currently on the IEEE Communications Society’s Board of Governors.
            Our goal is to publish quickly—the rapid peer review process is targeting a publication time frame of 10
            weeks for most accepted papers.
            This journal will publish high-quality, peer-reviewed papers covering all aspects of theory, design,
            practice, and application relating to computer and information processing science and technology.
            Be among the first published in the IEEE Open Journal of the Computer Society:
            • Article Processing Charges (APC) discounts are available to IEEE members and Antennas and Propagation
            Society members.
            • This journal is fully open and compliant with funder mandates, including Plan S. </p></div>
